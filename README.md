# Movie App 
    Welcome to the Movie App, a simple web application to explore and discover movies. Users can search for movies, view details, and watch trailers. A film, also called a movie or a motion picture, is a series of still photographs on film projected onto a screen using light in rapid succession. This application provies user with a large movie database. In this project the main and key API is OMDb API which helped me to get access to the large database of movies. This helped me to create website which shows a lot of information about movie and also YouTube Data API key is used. This API helped me to provide trialers of the movies from youtube. These two APIs are working as a column of this website. Also Website allows a lot of functionlaties which are will be described below. First of all, user have to succesfull sign in in order to, get access to the functionalties of the website.
